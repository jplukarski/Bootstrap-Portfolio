                <p>I graduated with a degree in English from Illinois State University in 2013. After graduating, I spent two and a half years working as a Quality Assurance Analyst in the call center of Avant. There, I audited phone calls made and taken by our Customer Support, Loan Verifications and Collections teams. After working at Avant, I worked as a Content Associate at CouponCabin.com. There, I worked with the Account Management team to manage and execute hundreds of paid placements weekly</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I love to play music and to write. I have played in various bands with friends throughout my life. I play guitar, bass, keyboards and the mandolin. Between April 2015 and December 2016, I ran my own online publication with a friend of mine called "Ghost Track." We focused mainly on local music in the Chicago and Champaign-Urbana areas, but also did stories about touring bands coming through the area.</p>
                <p>I also love sports. I am a huge White Sox, Bulls, Bears and Blackhawks fans. My two favorite baseball teams are the White Sox and whoever is playing the Cubs =]. In high school, I played tennis. In college, I played Ultimate frisbee. Whenever I tell people (my family) about that last fact, they just think I'm a hippy. But then my family came to a tournament and saw how professionally it was ran and that some of these blokes take the sport as series as any other sport.</p>
                <p>I love to travel. Before 2016, I hadn't been out of the midwest in almost five-teen years. I ragequite my job at Avant and volunteered to teach English in Thailand and ever since then I have caught the travel bug. I love traveling by myself because no one can tell me what to do. Since my trip to Thailand, I have traveled to Portland, Canada (okay I was really going to Detroit and it was cheaper to stay in Canada that particular weekend because it's only like a 10 minute drive), Ireland, Scotland, England and the Netherlands. Okay bye!</p>
